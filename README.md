# Streamlit App for the Churn prediction model
## Work in progress ... 
to do: 
1) add tabs with EDA and Features importance, 
2) 3 "lights" visual interpretation of Churn probabilities.

This project demonstrates the results of my [Churn Value classification](https://github.com/NuriaAk/Customers_churn_value_classification) machine learning project as a web application using [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) framework. The data used in this repo is the [Telco dataset](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113) from IBM.
